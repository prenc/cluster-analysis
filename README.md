# Analysis of complex phenotypes in patients with early hypertansion

An analysis pipeline is devised:
 - first, a gridsearch through various dimensionality reduction techniques, their parameters and clustering methods is conducted
 - then, the clusterings are assessed with clustering and other scores to establish the best one (silhouette score is considered the most important metric) 
 - in the end, a few explainability techniques are applied to give an insight into what drives particular clusters
